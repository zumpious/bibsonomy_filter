Many different communities have chosen to publish their datasets using Linked Data principles, which favors the integration of this information with many other sources published using the same principles and technologies. Such a scenario requires to develop techniques of Linked Data Summarization. The concept of a class is one of the core elements used to define the ontologies which sustain most of the existing KGs. Moreover, classes are an excellent tool to refer to an abstract idea which groups many individuals (or instances) in the context of a given KG, which is handy to use when producing summaries of its content. Rankings of class importance are a powerful summarization tool that can be used both to obtain a superficial view of the content of a given KG and to prioritize many different actions over the data (data quality checking, visualization, relevance for search engines\u2026). In this paper, we analyze existing techniques to measure class importance and propose a novel approach called ClassRank. We compare the class usage in SPARQL logs of different KGs with the importance ranking produced by the approaches evaluated. Then, we discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the evaluated techniques. Our experimentation suggests that ClassRank outperforms state-of-the-art approaches measuring class importance.",

Hence, it is hard to re-use results, compare model results or couple models at all. Ontologies provide a precisely defined vocabulary to build a common and shared conceptualisation of the energy domain. Here, we present the Open Energy Ontology (OEO) developed for the domain of energy systems analysis. Using the OEO provides several benefits for the community. First, it enables consistent annotation of large amounts of data from various research projects. One example is the Open Energy Platform (OEP). Adding such annotations makes data semantically searchable, exchangeable, re-usable and interoperable. Second, computational model coupling becomes much easier. The advantages of using an ontology such as the OEO are demonstrated with three use cases: data representation, data annotation and interface homogenisation. We also describe how the ontology can be used for linked open data (LOD).",

      "abstract": "The aim of this thesis is to support the development of RDF knowledge bases in a distributed collaborative setup. In this thesis a new methodology for distributed collaborative knowledge engineering \u2013 called Quit \u2013 is presented. It follows the premise that it is necessity to express dissent throughout a collaboration process and to provide individual workspaces for each collaborator. The approach is inspired by and based on the Git methodology for collaboration in software engineering. The state of the art analysis shows that no system is consequently transferring the Git methodology to knowledge engineering. The key features of the Quit methodology are independent workspaces for each user and a shared distributed workspace for the collaboration. Throughout the whole collaboration process data provenance plays an important role. To support the methodology the Quit Stack is implemented as a collection of microservices, that allow to integrate the Semantic Web data structure and standard interfaces with the distributed collaborative process. To complement the distributed data authoring, appropriate methods to support the data management process are researched. These management processes are in particular the creation and authoring of data as well as the publication and exploration of data. The application of the methodology is shown in various use cases for the distributed collaboration on organizational data and on research data. Further, the implementation is quantitatively compared to the related work. Finally, it can be concluded that the consequent approach followed by the Quit methodology enables a wide range of distributed Semantic Web knowledge engineering scenarios.",

Faceted search is a technique that allows narrowing down sets of information items by applying constraints over their properties, whereas facets correspond to properties of these items. While our work can be used to realise real-world faceted search user interfaces, our focus lies on the construction and benchmarking of faceted search queries over knowledge graphs. The RDF model exhibits several traits that seemingly make it a natural foundation for faceted search: all information items are represented as RDF resources, property values typically already correspond to meaningful semantic classifications, and with SPARQL there is a standard language for uniformly querying instance and schema information. However, although faceted search is ubiquitous today, it is typically not performed on the RDF model directly. Two major sources of concern are the complexity of query generation and the query performance. To overcome the former, our framework comes with an intermediate domain-specific language. Thereby our approach is SPARQL-driven which means that every faceted search information need is intensionally expressed as a single SPARQL query. In regard to the latter, we investigate the possibilities and limits of real-time SPARQL-driven faceted search on contemporary triple stores. We report on our findings by evaluating systems performance and correctness characteristics when executing a benchmark generated using our generation framework. All components, namely the benchmark generator, the benchmark runners and the underlying faceted search framework, are published freely available as open source.",

      "volume": "16","abstract": "Since its inception in 2007, DBpedia has been constantly releasing open data in RDF, extracted from various Wikimedia projects using a complex software system called the DBpedia Information Extraction Framework (DIEF). For the past 12 years, the software received a plethora of extensions by the community, which positively affected the size and data quality. Due to the increase in size and complexity, the release process was facing huge delays (from 12 to 17 months cycle), thus impacting the agility of the development. In this paper, we describe the new DBpedia release cycle including our innovative release workflow, which allows development teams (in particular those who publish large, open data) to implement agile, cost-efficient processes and scale up productivity. The DBpedia release workflow has been re-engineered, its new primary focus is on productivity and agility, to address the challenges of size and complexity. At the same time, quality is assured by implementing a comprehensive testing methodology. We run an experimental evaluation and argue that the implemented measures increase agility and allow for cost-effective quality-control and debugging and thus achieve a higher level of maintainability. As a result, DBpedia now publishes regular (i.e. monthly) releases with over 21 billion triples with minimal publishing effort.",

In this paper, we present an online ontology interface and augmented archive called DBpedia Archivo, that discovers, crawls, versions and archives ontologies on the DBpedia Databus. Based on this versioned crawl, different features, quality measures and, if possible, fixes are deployed to handle and stabilize the changes in the found ontologies at web-scale. A comparison to existing approaches and ontology repositories is given.",

      "pages": "150 - 154","abstract": "The majority of web applications nowadays are data-driven. However, that does not mean that all data is available while launching the respective application. While considering Web 2.0 applications, data is often fetched on-demand from remote web services, for example, after a location was provided, weather data could be fetched, and local news is loaded. This mashup approach is highly dynamical, i.e., based on the data input of the user, completely different execution paths might be performed. Currently, such workflows are implemented within the application logic requiring high development effort and maintenance of the implemented logic to prevent unintentional behavior. In this paper, we present a novel approach to integrate web services dynamically, to decrease deployment and maintenance costs and to enable the next generation of interlinked data web applications to enables application architects to (re)define the data integration in a descriptive way in an ontology, validate the workflows and define logical requirements. However, our approach is not just a design method but also a method for ad hoc integration of new services. Our approach has a significant impact on the effort for generating and maintaining dynamic applications.",
